As you probably already know, building codes can be a homesteader's worst enemy.  Especially when trying to get a new homestead off the ground on a budget building codes can throw a wrench in your plans.

For this reason, it is good to stay ahead of the game and know what structures you can build that will be exempt from local codes.  In the United States, the codes are usually enforced by county (or township, borough, census-district, etc.) but there are also some cities with their own rules as well as statewide exemptions.

Here at Successful Homestead we have been creating a database of these exemption documents (or websites) so we can have as much information accessible from one place as possible.  We will also be adding information on areas with very lax building codes (or none at all) so homesteaders and groups of homesteaders can more easily find land.  Keep an eye on this space and the blog for more info.
