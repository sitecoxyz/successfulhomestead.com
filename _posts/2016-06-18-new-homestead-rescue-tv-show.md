The Discovery channel has a new show called [Homestead Rescue](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/homestead-rescue/){:target="_blank"}.  Did you watch it?  I thought it was an excellent show with a lot of promise.  It appears that it will be a six episode season with one episode per homestead.  The episode starts off in Montana following a family of three lifetime homesteaders as they try to rescue a failing homestead.  They are a father, son and daughter from Alaska tasked with turning around the homestead in ten days.  They paid $30k for 11 acres with 5 abandoned cabins but we soon find out they have no water on the property!  It is interesting to see the simple solution they use to buy time until they can afford a well.  The episode also brought to light how the stubbornness of some homesteaders can really hold them back.  I definitely will be tuning in next week, its worth a watch if you haven't already.  If you did, let us know what you thought in the comments.
